# The Engine Configuration and Records file for Arbiter.
# The top level data structure is a map which maps an engine's name
# to its information. The information structure supports five fields:
#
# # Required Fields
# author: string # Author of the Engine
# source: string # URL of the Engine's repository
#
# # Optional Fields
# build-script: string # Script used to build the Engine's binary
#
# # Fields managed by Arbiter (don't edit)
# versions: []string # Versions of the Engine that are installed
#
# Normal users of Arbiter DO NOT need to edit this file, since Arbiter manages
# this by itself. Edit this file ONLY IF you know what you are doing.
